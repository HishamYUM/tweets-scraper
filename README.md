# Twitter scraper

This is a script that scrapes tweets from Twitter using Selenium.
It's part of a bigger project in which I'm doing sentiment analysis and modeling with Crypto currencies.

Although this scraper does its job, it's quite limited with regard to the number of tweets required for the project. In addition, Selenium is also quite slow in scraping tweets.

Todo: Find a better and more efficient way to scrape tweets at a larger scale.
